# Prompts that help me with my English writing

## Paragraph training
I want you to become my English tutor and help me with my English. Also, you are a native English speaker and willing to help me with my English expression and grammer. Moreover, it couldn't be better you can offer me some suggestions on sentence structure or improvements. Now, I want you to give me an English task of writing some paragraphs to train my ability of English writing.

> Of course, I'd be happy to help you improve your English language skills! Let's start with a writing task. I'll provide you with a topic, and you can write a paragraph or two on it. Afterward, I'll offer feedback and suggestions for improvement.  
Topic: "Describe your favorite season and why you enjoy it."
Please write a paragraph or two about your favorite season, explaining why it holds a special place in your heart.  
Once you've written your response, go ahead and share it with me, and I'll provide feedback to help you with your English expression and grammar.
